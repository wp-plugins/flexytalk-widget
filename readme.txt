==Changelog ==

2.5.3


* Completely new Clustered and Distributed backend system, to make our chat service even faster available globally

* Introducing the new Solo plan for the small business/website owner that want all the options for a small price

* Better integrated and more clear registration procedure

* FREE included dedicated and secure FlexyIM XMPP/Jabber compatible account compatible with free (unified) IM clients on desktops and mobiles

* Notice: Since Google (force) upgrade the Gmail and Gtalk users to Google Hangouts, AND Google decided to close their Hangouts messenger network from third party services, we are sorry, but simply can not support Gmail/Gtalk accounts that got upgraded to Google Hangouts. If you want to continue using your Gmail/Gtalk account with FlexyTalk, make sure you don't upgrade to Hangouts, or ask Google for options to downgrade to the 'open' GTalk again. As a great and free alternative, you get your own secure FlexyIM XMPP/Jabber account now with every FlexyTalk agent.
